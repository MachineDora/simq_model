121418,"i don't understand the prototype part of this . do you have 3 groups with your prototype and 3 without , or do you have 2 measures on each subject , or what ?"
74351,"please , say ( in the question ) what is "" paa "" and what is "" gmm "" ( gaussian mixture model or another ?"
121468,"it is difficult to advise . do you want to predict what are the top 100 values ( e . g . scores on some measure ) or is it crucial to predict which they are ( e . g . some name or descriptive text ) . in what sense are you trying to predict , including whether there is a time element to this ?"
121496,"x can't just be 'independent' . independence is a property of a set of random variables . you can use independence of x and y ( notice that that is independence with respect to both the variables ) to say that e [ xy ] = e [ x ] e [ y ] . but it doesn't make sense to say that x is "" independent "" because the natural next question would be "" independent of what ?"
121424,"your dependent variable is linear , while independent variables are circular ?"
121509,"what is "" the book by a . field "" ?"
121510,this reads a bit like a rather routine textbook question ; is this for some subject ?
121555,how are you dealing with the dependence in the data ?
121579,"where is this "" jump "" whereof you speak ?"
121592,"it really does depends on the data and the decision . any way , what does "" inaccuracy "" mean here ?"
121600,couldn't you simply bootstrap this ?
35940,"this is easy to do in r . 1st question : am i correct that you want 75 % of all cases to be { var1 = . 03 , var2 = 0 } & 25 % for all other combos , & not 3 units there for every 1 unit in each of the other combos ( ie , 37 . 5 % ) ?"
121431,"what do you mean by "" gives an indeterminate mean and sd "" ?"
121539,"how do you understand "" shape "" ?"
121638,"when you say "" sent out to a population "" . . . do you mean he population about which you wish to make inference ?"
121589,"i'm sure i'm missing something , but why not treat all groups as one big sample , compute the mean and the sd ( correcting for finite sample size ) , and then look for outliers ( correcting for sample size in each group ) ?"
121691,"i think this question could be rephrased to be more appropriate for this site . maybe something simple like "" what distinguishes biostats from 'vanilla' stats ?"
121659,"my concern is , why are you using a single model ?"
121651,statastic : . . . or is then there something off with your model ?
121662,"the initial statement is false in general ( it's false for two separate reasons ) . what is your source ( your link is missing ) , and what does it actually say ?"
121781,"the pr curve is fragile , and not well-defined ( at 0 recall , the precision is not defined ) . maybe something like classic average precision is the better choice ?"
121782,"looking at the year parameter estimates , they're all about the same except for 1997 , 1998 , 2006 and 2007 . you could estimate coefficients for just those years ( recoding ` data $ strange_years - factor ( ifelse ( as . character ( data $ year ) % in % c ( "" 1997 "" , "" 1998 "" , "" 2006 "" , "" 2007 "" ) , as . character ( data $ year ) , "" normal year "" ) ) ` ) . how many observations do you have per year ?"
121796,"your information does not seem internally consistent , unless i misread the graphs or the notation . the first illustration shows no connection between $ a $ and $ c $ , yet your formula includes a term "" $ p_ { ac } $ "" which seems to imply those nodes * are * directly connected with an edge that has probability $ p_ { ac } $ of failing . you cannot use this notation to refer both to the probability of a single edge failing * and * to the probability of a path failing , because some nodes connected by single edges are connected by other paths , too . so what exactly does this notation mean ?"
121810,what does a q-q plot of the anova residuals look like ?
121811,"i do not understand what the difficulty is : just because the lines appear to have small slopes does not change the formula for finding their intersection ! ( in fact , the "" $ times 10 ^ 4 $ "" in the upper left corner suggests most of these lines have enormous slopes . ) what is the connection between this problem and the focus of our site , which is statistics , data analysis , and machine learning ?"

122015,"why not try regression , and predict the missing values based on a generalized hypothesis ?"
121997,"your formula for $ p ( theta ) $ does not give a probability distribution for $ theta in [ 0 , 1 ] $ . perhaps $ theta $ is supposed to be restricted to a narrower interval ?"
122039,"can you put a reference to a paper or such showing what you mean by "" elastic net "" ?"
122055,"often these vifs , large as they are , would not be a huge concern ( such as in a cross-validated predictive setting ) , but since your model was derived via stepwise regression they call into question the choice of variables . rather than going further , as requested , would you consider starting over with a better technique of variable selection ?"
114088,have you tried k-k-fold cross validation to determine the best k ?
122094,"when you say "" does the central limit theorem apply "" . . . but it's not clear what you're trying to apply it to . note that the central limit theorem talks about the distribution of standardized averages when $ lim_ { n to infty } $ , not something you might notice when $ n = 7 $ . what is the limiting process you're considering ?"

122478,what does split-file mean ?
122553,"much about this question is unclear . because the mean is not invariant under data transformations , it is not apparent what distinction you are trying to make in the first paragraph . also , since you refer both to a "" posterior "" and a "" prior , "" presumably you are already adopting a "" bayesian approach .

254734,it seems like you are using the ` lme ( ) ` function from the ` nlme ` package and not ` lmer ( ) ` as you indicated . furthermore your random term specifies ` site ` and ` plot ` which are not present in your example data . also it seems based on the data you provided you only have one tree per treatment and block ?
254761,recurrence ( as you probably know ) means you return to the state infinitely often while transient means that at some point you will never return to that particular state . the summation result must have something to do with these definitions . does the notation for p_jj mean the probability of return to j within n steps ?

118336,say your model is based off of category a ( ie y ~ a ) . and say that a has 4 categories . your model should look like y ~ b0 ( a = = 1 ) b1 ( a = = 2 ) b2 ( a = = 3 ) b3 . where b # is the respective beta . the case when a is equal to the forth category is handled by the intercept . does this help clarify your questions wrt categorical regression ?
118430,in general it wouldn't seem sensible to model an average egg mass with a poisson distribution ( which only applies to a unitless count variable ) . perhaps you intended to use a log-normal ( ` lmer ( log ( avg_egg_mass ) ~ . . . ` ) or a gamma model ?

120312,is this for a course ?
120803,"this question seems to confuse the roles of independent and dependent variables . in logistic regression , the response is a bernoulli variable with parameter $ p $ . the logit link is one way to model the limited range of $ p $ , which can extend only from $ 0 $ to $ 1 $ . * there are otherwise no restrictions on independent variables , * just as there are no restrictions on the ivs in ordinary regression . it would therefore appear that this question concerns a problem that just doesn't exist . have you perhaps mis-typed "" independent "" for "" dependent "" or * vice versa * ?"
120801,"a retrospective dataset like this might be useful for exploration and setting up an adequate study in the future , but with so much potential for confounding it seems too much to hope that any analysis could address the questions you are most concerned about . have you considered the possibility of making some random choices in the awarding of these programs ?"

307543,fourier models are not recommended as they often misinterpret the data . what we have done in this kind of problem setting is to form a model at the daily level taking into account memory plus both known and unknown deterministic structure . we then incorporate the daily history and forecasts into 30 models ( one for each minute ) . subsequent forecasts can then be adjusted in either a top-down or bottom-up method . . . is this an academic exercise ?
